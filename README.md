# blakes-homelab

Welcome to my personal homelab! I am currently a SOC analyst and this is where I keep updates and writeups of all the personal projects I do. These projects help me expand my skillset and I have a lot of fun doing so.

## Current Focus:
- Designing a SOC in my room to develop a deep understanding of blue team operations
- Creating with arduino to better understand embedded systems, hardware, and physical layer security
- Beating HackTheBox ctf challenges to grow my red team skills
  
### Current Projects: 
- Building a SOC in my room and having it generate detections in my environment
- Making an arduino project to report the weather via a Splunk dashboard

## All Projects:
| Lab | Summary | Status |
|-----|---------|--------|
|[01 - Building my at home SOC](labs/lab01-SOC-build.md)| Building a SOC for my home network and using it to generate detections/learn new tools | In Progress |  
|[02 - Splunk Weather Report](labs/lab02-weather-station.md)|  Making an arduino to report the weather via a Splunk dashboard | In Progress |
