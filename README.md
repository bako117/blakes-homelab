Welcome to my personal homelab! I am currently a SOC analyst and this is where I keep updates and writeups of all the personal projects I do. These projects help me expand my skillset and I have a lot of fun doing so. 
##Current Focus:
- Designing a SOC in my room to develop a deep understanding of blue team operations
- Creating with arduino to better understand embedded systems, hardware, and physical layer security
- Beating HackTheBox ctf challenges to grow my red team skills
  
##Current Projects: 
- Building my at home SOC
- Making an arduino to report the weather via a Splunk dashboard
