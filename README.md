# blakes-homelab

Welcome to my personal homelab! I am currently a SOC analyst and this is where I keep updates and writeups of all the personal projects I do. These projects help me expand my skillset and I have a lot of fun doing so.

## Current Focus:
- Designing a SOC in my room to develop a deep understanding of blue team operations
- Creating with arduino to better understand embedded systems, hardware, and physical layer security
- Beating HackTheBox ctf challenges to grow my red team skills
  
## All Projects:
A project index table that lists every project Iâ€™ve worked on, with direct links to their write-ups.
- Standalone or major projects are numbered with a single integer (e.g., 1).
- Sub-projects or components of a larger project are referenced using hierarchical notation (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3), where:
      - X = the parent project identifier
      - Y = the sub-project identifier under that parent
This structure makes it easy to see which efforts are part of a larger initiative and which stand independently. Click on any project name to see more.
