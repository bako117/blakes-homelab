# Command Line Python Budgeting App  
## Summary
**First Started:** August 2025  

**End-Date:** Completed (v1) â€” future improvements possible  

**Overview:**  
This project is a command line Python application designed to track expenses, budgets, and account balances in an efficient, lightweight way. It provides category-based expense tracking, summaries, and persistent saving/loading of data. The app runs directly in a terminal environment and is tailored for personal finance management.  

**Goal/Idea:** Build a personal budgeting tool that is simple to run anywhere, teaches practical Python development, and provides real-world value.  
- Track expenses by category  
- View summaries of income/expenses and remaining balance  
- Persist data between sessions with save/load functionality  
- Support removing categories, adjusting balances, and handling uncategorized expenses automatically  

## Skills Learned
- Python programming (file I/O, JSON data handling, CLI interaction)  
- Designing user-friendly command line tools  
- Data persistence (saving/loading budgeting periods)  
- Debugging and iterative feature development  
- Code organization and feature extension  

## Outcome
A fully functioning command line budgeting app that allows me to:  
- Add/remove expense categories  
- Enter expenses with optional descriptions  
- Automatically handle uncategorized expenses under "Misc"  
- Track and update overall account balance across budgeting periods  
- View summaries showing spending per category and total balances  

This app has practical use for personal finance and demonstrates Python development skills in a tangible, portfolio-ready way.
